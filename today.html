        <h3> January 26 </h3>
        <h4> You've journaled 3 days in a row... Keep going! </h4>

        <p> Today was awesome! Although it was so busy, I was going crazy. 
            It's unreal how your day can fill up as full and packed as mine 
            was! Although, I know other people have it way worse than me--all 
            I had to worry about was making sure I got to class on time and 
            got all my homework done. I long for the day that the phrase, 
            "Dangit, I wish I could, but I have homework" is completely gone 
            from my vocabulary.
